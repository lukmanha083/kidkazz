name: "Playwright E2E Tests"

# NOTE: These E2E tests require access to production backend services which have
# country-based IP filtering (Indonesia only). GitHub Actions runners are in the US,
# so tests will fail unless run with a VPN or the IP filter is disabled.
#
# For now, this workflow only runs when manually triggered with workflow_dispatch.
# Run locally with: cd apps/erp-dashboard && pnpm test:e2e
